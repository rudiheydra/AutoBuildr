### Feature #3: AgentRun SQLite Table Schema - COMPLETED

**Status:** PASSING

**Description:** Create the agent_runs table tracking execution instances with all required columns and constraints.

**Verification Summary:**
- Step 1: PRAGMA table_info(agent_runs) - PASS (table exists with 13 columns)
- Step 2: id column is VARCHAR(36) primary key - PASS
- Step 3: agent_spec_id FK -> agent_specs.id ON DELETE CASCADE - PASS
- Step 4: status column is VARCHAR(20) with default 'pending' - PASS
- Step 5: started_at and completed_at are DATETIME nullable - PASS
- Step 6: turns_used, tokens_in, tokens_out are INTEGER with CHECK >= 0 - PASS
- Step 7: final_verdict is VARCHAR(20) nullable - PASS
- Step 8: acceptance_results is JSON type - PASS
- Step 9: error is TEXT nullable - PASS
- Step 10: retry_count is INTEGER with CHECK >= 0 - PASS
- Step 11: Indexes ix_agentrun_spec and ix_agentrun_status exist - PASS

**Implementation Notes:**
- The AgentRun model was already defined in api/agentspec_models.py
- Database migration ran successfully via _migrate_add_agentspec_tables()
- All 5 AutoBuildr tables created: agent_specs, acceptance_specs, agent_runs, artifacts, agent_events
- All CHECK constraints verified for non-negative integer columns
- Foreign key with ON DELETE CASCADE properly set up
- Default values for status ('pending') and integer columns (0) verified

**Current Progress:**
- Feature #3: AgentRun SQLite Table Schema - PASSING
- Total: 1/85 features passing

**Next Steps:**
- Continue with other assigned features
- The agent_runs table is now ready for use by the HarnessKernel
